In Legolas v0.5, the schema version author controls which fields have their types surfaced as type parameters in Legolas-generated record types via the field::(<:F) syntax in @version.\nAdditionally, to include type parameters associated to fields in a parent schema, they must be re-declared in the child schema. For example, the package LegolasFlux declares a ModelV1 version with a field weights::(<:Union{Missing,Weights}). LegolasFlux includes an example with a schema extension DigitsRowV1 which extends ModelV1. This @version call must re-declare the field weights to be parametric in order for the DigitsRowV1 struct to also have a type parameter for this field.\nIn Legolas v0.4,  @row-generated Legolas.Row constructors accepted and propagated any non-schema-required fields provided by the caller. In Legolas v0.5, @version-generated record type constructors will discard any non-schema-required fields provided by the caller. When upgrading code that formerly \"implicitly extended\" a given schema version by propagating non-required fields, it is advisable to instead explicitly declare a new extension of the schema version to capture the propagated fields as required fields; or, if it makes more sense for a given use case, one may instead define a new schema version that adds these propagated fields as required fields directly to the schema (likely declared as ::Union{Missing,T} to allow them to be missing).","category":"page"},{"location":"upgrade/#Deserializing-old-tables-with-Legolas-v0.5-1","page":"Upgrading from v0.4 to v0.5","title":"Deserializing old tables with Legolas v0.5","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"upgrade/#","page":"Upgrading from v0.4 to v0.5","title":"Upgrading from v0.4 to v0.5","text":"Generally, tables serialized with earlier versions of Legolas can be de-serialized with Legolas v0.5, making it only a \"code-breaking\" change, rather than a \"data-breaking\" change.

Note that these tables are still deserializable as plain Arrow tables regardless, so it may not be worthwhile to provide a bespoke deprecation/compatibility pathway in the  Legolas-v0.5-ready version package unless your use case merits it (i.e. the impact surface would be high for your package's users).

Therefore, one must decide what to do with any non-required fields present in serialized Legolas.Row values upon deserialization. A common approach is to implement a deprecation/compatibility pathway within the relevant surrounding @version declaration. For example, this LegolasFlux example uses a function compat_config to handle old Legolas.Row values, but does not add any handling for non-required fields, which will be discarded if present. If one did not want non-required fields to be discarded, these fields could be handled by throwing an error or warning, or defining a schema version extension that captured them, or defining a new version of the relevant schema to capture them (e.g. adding a field like extras::Union{Missing, NamedTuple}).","category":"page"},{"location":"arrow-concepts/#Arrow-Related-Concepts/Conventions-1","page":"Arrow-Related Concepts/Conventions","title":"Arrow-Related Concepts/Conventions","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"arrow-concepts/#","page":"Arrow-Related Concepts/Conventions","title":"Arrow-Related Concepts/Conventions","text":"note: Note\nIf you're a newcomer to Legolas.jl, please familiarize yourself with the tour before diving into this documentation.","category":"page"},{"location":"arrow-concepts/#","page":"Arrow-Related Concepts/Conventions","title":"Arrow-Related Concepts/Conventions","text":"Legolas.jl's target (de)serialization format, Arrow, already features wide cross-language adoption, enabling Legolas-serialized tables to be seamlessly read into many non-Julia environments.
